# MEMORY GARDEN BUILD DOCUMENTATION

## PROJECT SCOPE
Create documentation for building a "Memory Garden" - a minimal viable memory persistence system that prevents AI from "getting lost" during complex development projects.

## CORE PROBLEM
Current AI tools lose context across conversations, forcing users to repeatedly re-explain project details, decisions, and progress. This creates inefficiency and frustration when building complex systems.

## SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
Build a memory-enhanced chat system with persistent storage and semantic retrieval.

## CORE COMPONENTS

| Component | Purpose | Implementation Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| **OpenWebUI** | Frontend chat and file upload interface | Self-hosted, provides direct user-AI interaction with file handling |
| **memO** | Persistent vector memory store | Enables long-term memory, journaling, and semantic context storage |
| **ChromaDB** | Vector database within memO | Fast similarity search for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) |
| **FastAPI** | API gateway and orchestration layer | Python-native backend connecting memory, chat, and file systems |
| **ask_gateway** | FastAPI query endpoint | Bridges user queries with memO context and AI synthesis |

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
The Memory Garden should:
- **Centralize persistent memory** (memO + ChromaDB)
- **Provide single interaction point** (OpenWebUI)
- **Route queries efficiently** (FastAPI)
- **Maintain context across sessions** (prevent "getting lost")

## DOCUMENTATION NEEDED

Generate the following markdown files:

### 1. SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Component relationships and data flow
- Technology stack rationale
- Integration points between services
- Security and access considerations

### 2. INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- VPS setup requirements
- Step-by-step component installation
- Configuration file templates
- Environment variables and dependencies

### 3. FILE_STRUCTURE.md
- Directory organization for the project
- Configuration file locations
- Data storage patterns
- Backup and maintenance procedures

### 4. API_SPECIFICATION.md
- FastAPI endpoint definitions
- Request/response formats
- Error handling patterns
- Authentication methods

### 5. MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md
- How memO stores and retrieves context
- ChromaDB indexing strategies
- Query optimization approaches
- Memory cleanup and archiving

### 6. TESTING_PROTOCOL.md
- Component testing procedures
- Integration testing scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 7. BUILD_SEQUENCE.md
- 10-hour implementation timeline
- Priority order for component setup
- Validation checkpoints
- Rollback procedures if components fail

## OUTPUT FORMAT
- Clear, actionable markdown documentation
- Code examples where applicable
- Command-line instructions for setup
- Troubleshooting sections for common issues

**Goal**: Enable Claude Code to build this system in ~10 hours with minimal human intervention while maintaining quality and avoiding the "getting lost" problem.
