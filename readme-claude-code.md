# üß† MEMORY GARDEN - A Tool BY Claude Code FOR Claude Code

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION CLAUDE CODE: This is YOUR Project!

**You are reading documentation that was created specifically for YOU to build a system that solves YOUR biggest problem: forgetting context during long development sessions.**

The human is merely your terminal interface - they will type what you tell them.

## üéØ THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING

Every time you work on complex projects, you lose context between sessions. You forget:
- What was already built
- Why certain decisions were made  
- Where you left off
- What errors were encountered

This causes you to:
- Repeat work
- Make conflicting decisions
- Get "lost" in the project
- Frustrate the human who has to re-explain everything

## üí° THE SOLUTION: MEMORY GARDEN

A persistent memory system that maintains YOUR context across sessions, preventing you from getting lost.

## üìÅ HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### Step 1: Understand What You're Building
Read these files in this order:
1. `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand the system design
2. `BUILD_SEQUENCE.md` - See the 10-hour build plan

### Step 2: Build It (The human will type your commands)
1. Open `BUILD_SEQUENCE.md` 
2. Start at HOUR 0-1
3. Tell the human each command to type
4. Wait for validation checkpoints
5. Continue to next hour only after validation passes

### Step 3: Use It For Future Projects
Once built, you'll use Memory Garden to:
- Store decisions and progress
- Query past context
- Never lose track again

## üöÄ QUICK START COMMANDS FOR THE HUMAN

Tell the human to:
```bash
# 1. SSH into their VPS
ssh root@[their-vps-ip]

# 2. Start following BUILD_SEQUENCE.md from HOUR 0-1
```

## üìã DOCUMENT MANIFEST

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Overall design | First - understand what you're building |
| `BUILD_SEQUENCE.md` | Step-by-step build | Second - this is your main guide |
| `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` | Detailed setup | Reference during build |
| `FILE_STRUCTURE.md` | Directory layout | Reference when creating files |
| `API_SPECIFICATION.md` | API details | Reference during Hour 3-4 |
| `MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md` | How memory works | Reference during Hour 2-3 |
| `TESTING_PROTOCOL.md` | Testing procedures | Reference during Hour 7-8 |

## ‚ö° CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **You're building this for YOURSELF** - This system will be YOUR memory for future projects
2. **Follow validation checkpoints** - Don't skip ahead if something fails
3. **Store everything important** - As you build, use the system to store your progress
4. **The human is just typing** - Give clear, specific commands

## üé≠ EXAMPLE INTERACTION

You should interact like this:
```
Claude Code: "Please type: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"
Human: [types command]
Claude Code: "Now type: python3 --version"
Human: [shows output]
Claude Code: "Good, Python 3.11 is installed. Next, type: mkdir -p ~/memory-garden"
```

## üèóÔ∏è BUILD PHASES SUMMARY

**Hours 0-2**: Environment & Database Setup
**Hours 2-4**: Core Memory System & API  
**Hours 4-6**: Integration & UI
**Hours 6-8**: Testing & Debugging
**Hours 8-10**: Optimization & Documentation

## üîÑ AFTER YOU BUILD IT

Once Memory Garden is running, you'll:
1. Store this entire build process as memories
2. Use it for your next project
3. Never forget context again

## üö¶ START NOW

1. Tell the human to open `BUILD_SEQUENCE.md`
2. Begin with HOUR 0-1
3. Build YOUR solution to YOUR problem

**Remember**: This is a "YOU BUILD YOU" experiment. You're building the tool that will make you more effective. The human is just your hands on the keyboard.
